                <p>This API has mainly been built as a passion project for myself and my friends to use; it holds data on Game Enhancer Providers and their correlating Products. Giving a good description and/or chuck of info so they know who to choose next!</p>
                <p>The only Accessable Data for users will be GET requests for Products and Providers, Spoofers sometime down the line too</p>

            <hr class="new4"></hr>
            <p>Here at Provide we heavily use Third-Party Applications to improve our gameplay, you can trust myself and the communities I have around me to secure your next best cheat.</p>
            <p>The data I enter is not falsified, though Developers ARE very weird about detection histories but I have eyes and ears in many servers - with that being said I am always happy to be receiving more info so I can keep status' on track!</p>
