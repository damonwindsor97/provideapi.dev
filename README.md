    <h2>About The Project<h2/>
  </div>
This API has mainly been built as a passion project for myself and my friends to use; it holds data on Game Enhancer Providers and their correlating Products. Giving a good description and/or chuck of info so they know who to choose next!
      <br />
       <br />
 <h3>What is Provide API?</h3>
       <br />
Provide API that provides their users with common and known providers of game enhancers.
Will feature a few; Providers, Developers & their products. In the future I may expand to Spoofers, things to expect;
      <ul>
          <li>Products Available</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>Features
          <li>Aimbot</li>
          <li>ESP / Visuals</li>
          <li>MISC</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
          <li>isUpdated</li>
          <li>isDetected</li>
          <li></li>
      </ul>
      <p>And much, much more ready and in the works</p>

    <h2>Why should people choose Provide?<h2/>
  </div>
<p>Here at Provide we heavily use Third-Party Applications to improve our gameplay, you can trust myself and the communities I have around me to secure your next best cheat.</p>
<p>The data I enter is not falsified, but Developers ARE very weird about detection histories but I have eyes and ears in many servers - with that being said I am always happy to be receiving more info so I can keep status' on track!</p>


### Sometime down the line...
* I will implement a very simple Front-End for those with Admin permissions to POST, PUT & DELETE data easily.
* A Discord Bot to display data with
* Connection to Respawn/EA API to auto detect updates
